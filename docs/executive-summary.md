# Executive Summary

Betswave is a decentralized sports betting and gaming platform built on Hedera. It is designed to give users a fair, transparent, and non-custodial betting experience. All betting on Betswave happens in **USDC**, while the platform’s native token, **WAVE**, is used for governance, rewards, and platform benefits.

Betswave is built around three core components.

## 1) USDC-Based Betting

All bets on Betswave are **placed and settled in USDC**. This keeps payouts stable and easy to understand, avoiding price fluctuations caused by token volatility.

Betswave smart contracts handle:

- bet placement,
- settlement based on results, and
- automated payouts.

Users remain in control of their funds throughout the process and do not need to rely on a central operator to release funds.

## 2) WAVE Token Utility

**WAVE** is a Hedera-based token with a **fixed supply of 1,000,000,000** tokens. WAVE is **not** used for betting.

Instead, WAVE is used for:

- staking,
- voting (governance),
- rewards,
- fee-related benefits, and
- access to platform features.

WAVE rewards are designed to align with real platform growth. Tokens are distributed based on actual platform usage, such as:

- betting activity,
- participation in tournaments and games, and
- other on-platform activities.

This approach is intended so that rewards scale with adoption and usage.

## 3) Governance and Safety

Betswave is community-driven with a safety-first approach.

- In early phases, important risk-related decisions are managed by a **trusted multi-signature team** to protect users.
- Over time, governance is progressively transitioned to the community through a **DAO** framework.

Only users who stake WAVE can vote. Longer staking increases voting power, and limits are designed to reduce concentration risk and avoid control by a small set of large holders.

## Core Utilities

Betswave’s core utilities and platform principles include:

- **USDC-only betting** with on-chain settlement, enabling stable payouts and full user fund control.
- **Peer-to-peer (P2P) betting**, where users bet directly against other users instead of the platform.
- **Transparent fee model** with a flat **1.5%** platform fee (**Non-ORCA Members**) applied upfront, with no hidden charges and no deductions during withdrawals.
- **On-chain fee enforcement**, where all fees are visible and verifiable through smart contracts.
- **WAVE staking** for governance participation, platform benefits, and reward access.
- **Usage-based rewards**, distributed based on real platform activity such as betting volume, participation, and referral programs.
- **DAO-governed treasury frameworks**, controlling incentives, liquidity support, and ecosystem programs.
- **Privacy-first access**, allowing users to connect via Web3 wallets or email login using Web3Auth without storing personal data.

## Why Betswave

Most betting platforms are centralized. They control user funds, charge unclear fees, and often reduce payouts using hidden charges. Betswave is built differently.

Betswave enables **P2P betting**, where users bet directly against other users rather than the platform. The platform charges:

- a flat **1.5% fee** for **Non-ORCA Members**, and
- a flat **0.5% fee** for **ORCA Members**,

with no hidden fees or charges. Fees are clear, verifiable, and enforced on-chain.

Privacy is a key focus. Users can log in using Web3 wallets (e.g., MetaMask or Phantom) or sign in with email using Web3Auth. Betswave does not store personal or private information, enabling users to bet, earn, and withdraw while staying anonymous.

By combining P2P betting, low and transparent fees, user privacy, and on-chain settlement, Betswave aims to create a fair and open betting platform.

A portion of platform fees may be used for rewards, organizing tournaments, liquidity support, security reserves, and ecosystem growth. These decisions are made through community voting and are not meant to guarantee profits or returns.

## Goal

Betswave’s goal is simple: to build a transparent, user-owned, and community-driven betting platform where players stay in control.
