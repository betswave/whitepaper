# Market Opportunity

Sports betting and gaming are high-frequency digital markets where users care most about three outcomes:

1. predictable payouts,
2. transparent fees and settlement, and
3. confidence that funds can be withdrawn without friction.

In practice, many platforms are centralized intermediaries. This often creates user concerns around custody, unclear fee structures, and the inability to independently verify how results, settlements, and payouts are processed. These pain points become more visible as users engage in repeat play and larger volumes.

Betswave’s opportunity is to align platform structure with what users already want:

- **Non-custodial control**: users retain control of their funds rather than relying on a centralized operator.
- **On-chain settlement visibility**: key actions are handled by smart contracts, allowing verification of fee logic and settlement outcomes.
- **Stable value denomination**: USDC-based betting aims to make user experience and payouts easy to understand, without exposure to token price volatility.
- **Peer-to-peer format**: P2P betting supports a model where users bet against other users rather than the platform itself.
- **Privacy-first access**: users can participate via Web3 wallets or email login using Web3Auth without the platform storing personal data.

As the ecosystem matures, platforms that combine transparent settlement, stable value payouts, and user-controlled custody can reduce trust barriers and support broader adoption—especially among users who want clarity and control without complex onboarding.

Betswave is positioned to serve this demand while evolving governance toward a community-led framework and keeping incentives tied to real platform activity.
