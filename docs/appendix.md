## Glossary

**Betswave**  
A decentralized sports betting and gaming platform built on Hedera.

**Hedera / HTS (Hedera Token Service)**  
Hedera is the underlying network. HTS refers to Hedera’s native token framework used to issue and manage tokens.

**USDC**  
A stablecoin used on Betswave for placing and settling bets to support stable, predictable payouts.

**WAVE**  
A Hedera (HTS) token with a fixed max supply of 1,000,000,000. WAVE is not used for betting; it is used for governance, rewards, and platform benefits.

**ORCA NFT**  
A premium, non-transferable (soulbound) ERC-721 membership token with an annual subscription model, tiered benefits, and on-chain expiration.

**Non-custodial**  
A model where users retain control of their funds rather than depositing them into a centralized platform wallet.

**P2P (Peer-to-peer) betting**  
A betting model where users bet directly against other users instead of betting against the platform as the counterparty.

**On-chain settlement**  
Settlement logic and fee enforcement are executed through smart contracts and are verifiable on the blockchain.

**DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**  
A governance framework where decisions are proposed and voted on by eligible participants (in this case, staked WAVE holders).

**Multi-signature (Multi-sig)**  
A wallet/control mechanism requiring multiple approvals to execute sensitive actions, used for safety-first operations in early stages.

**Staking / Locking**  
Committing tokens for a period to access governance participation and other benefits. Longer lock periods can increase voting power.

**TGE (Token Generation Event)**  
The event when tokens are initially issued and made available per the defined distribution plan.

**IDO (Initial DEX Offering)**  
A public sale mechanism typically conducted through a decentralized exchange environment for fair access and price discovery.

**Vesting**  
A scheduled release of tokens over time to reduce sudden circulating supply increases.

**Cliff**  
An initial period during which no vested tokens are released, followed by a vesting schedule.

**Liquidity Pool**  
Tokens allocated to support market liquidity, reduce slippage, and enable smoother trading and price discovery.

**Slippage**  
The difference between expected trade price and executed trade price, often influenced by liquidity depth.

**Buyback / Burn (optional mechanisms)**  
Governance-controllable mechanisms that may be activated to purchase tokens from the market (buyback) and/or remove tokens from circulation (burn), subject to predefined rules and decisions.

## Definitions (for clarity)

- **“Member”** refers to a wallet holding an active (non-expired) ORCA NFT.
- **“Non-member”** refers to a wallet that does not hold an active ORCA NFT.
- **“Voting power”** refers to governance weight derived from staked WAVE and lock duration, subject to per-wallet caps.
