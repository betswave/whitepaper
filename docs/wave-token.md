# WAVE Token (Utility + Economics)

## Overview and Supply

WAVE is a Hedera (HTS) token with a fixed maximum supply of **1,000,000,000** tokens. The supply is fully capped and **non-inflationary**, distributed through predefined allocations and vesting schedules.

WAVE is **not** used for placing bets. Bets on Betswave are placed and settled in **USDC**. WAVE exists to enable **incentives**, **governance**, and **platform benefits**, supporting predictable token economics and long-term sustainability.

## Allocation and Release

WAVE allocations and vesting schedules are designed to align distribution with platform maturity, liquidity needs, and long-term incentives.

**Allocation & Vesting Summary**

| Category            |   % | Vesting / Release                                        |
| ------------------- | --: | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ecosystem / Rewards | 30% | Usage-based emissions                                    |
| Treasury / House    | 20% | Locked (governance-controlled)                           |
| IDO (Public)        | 15% | 20–30% at TGE; remainder vested (total TGE unlock ≤ 40%) |
| Team                | 15% | 12-month cliff; 36-month linear vesting                  |
| Private / Seed      |  7% | 6–12 month vesting                                       |
| Advisors            |  3% | 12-month vesting                                         |
| Liquidity Pool      | 10% | Locked                                                   |

> **Note:** “Usage-based” emissions are tied to measurable usage metrics (e.g., betting volume, active users), preventing token distribution that is detached from platform performance.

### Ecosystem & Rewards (30%) — Usage-based

This allocation provides runway to incentivize user acquisition, retention, staking, loyalty programs, and ecosystem growth. Emissions are tied directly to measurable usage metrics, helping ensure rewards grow when the platform grows.  
**Rationale:** Betting platforms grow through sustained engagement. Usage-based rewards align distribution with value creation.

### Treasury Reserve / House (20%) — Locked

The treasury serves as the protocol’s financial backbone. It is reserved for liquidity support, buybacks, insurance coverage, partnerships, and operational contingencies. Tokens remain locked under governance and are released only according to predefined rules.  
**Rationale:** Real-money betting requires capital discipline and risk buffers to ensure trust and continuity.

### Public Sale (IDO) (15%) — Partial TGE unlock, remainder vested

This allocation supports broad access and price discovery while limiting early sell pressure. A portion is unlocked at TGE, with the remainder released via vesting.  
**Rationale:** Balances liquidity and accessibility with long-term token health and discourages short-term flipping.

### Team (15%) — 12-month cliff + 36-month linear vesting

Team tokens are subject to a one-year cliff followed by linear vesting over three years. No tokens are accessible at launch.  
**Rationale:** Ensures long-term commitment, prevents early extraction, and aligns incentives with sustained platform success.

### Private / Seed (7%) — 6–12 months vesting

Early investors receive a limited allocation with extended vesting to reflect early-stage risk while protecting markets from sudden supply shocks.  
**Rationale:** Rewards early support while maintaining fairness and stability for later participants.

### Advisors (3%) — 12 months vesting

Advisor tokens vest over one year to align compensation with meaningful contributions during early growth.  
**Rationale:** Encourages active participation and discourages passive advisory arrangements.

### Liquidity Pool (10%) — Locked

Dedicated liquidity is reserved to support smoother trading, reduced slippage, and reliable price discovery. Liquidity is locked to protect users.  
**Rationale:** Deep, stable liquidity supports user trust and market confidence at launch.

## Governance

### Safety-first, gradual decentralization

WAVE governance is community-driven with a safety-first approach. In early stages, core operations and risk-sensitive decisions are handled by a trusted multi-signature team. As the platform grows, more decisions are progressively opened to the community through a DAO.

### Voting power is earned, not just bought

Only **staked WAVE** tokens can be used to vote. Users who lock their tokens for longer periods receive more voting power, rewarding long-term commitment. Voting power per wallet is capped to reduce the risk of governance dominance by large holders.

### What the community can vote on

The DAO can propose and vote on:

- Reward and incentive emission rates
- Treasury usage frameworks (buybacks, grants, partnerships)
- Liquidity incentives
- Fee structures and staking-based discounts
- Activation of optional mechanisms such as token buybacks or burns

### What stays outside DAO control

For platform safety and regulatory reasons, the DAO does not control:

- Real-time betting risk limits
- Emergency actions or security responses
- Compliance-sensitive decisions
